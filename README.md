# cybermoranda-cids
CyberMoranda CIDS (Cognitive Intrusion Defense System) is a behavior-based, ethical intrusion detection prototype that analyzes intent instead of signatures, applies non-punitive containment, and generates explainable security decisions. Built as an MVP for learning, research, and Imagine Cup.
