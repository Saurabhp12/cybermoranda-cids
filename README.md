# CyberMoranda CIDS

CyberMoranda CIDS (Cognitive Intrusion Defense System) is a behavior-based,
ethical security prototype designed for modern web applications.

## Problem
Traditional firewalls block attackers instantly.
This often creates false positives and teaches attackers how to bypass defenses.

## Solution
CyberMoranda CIDS observes behavior instead of reacting aggressively.
It assigns a risk score and applies ethical containment.

## Key Features
- Behavioral risk analysis
- Explainable security decisions
- Non-punitive containment
- Decoy-based observation
- Professional SOC-style interface

## Azure AI (Planned Architecture)
Azure AI is used as a post-analysis layer to explain security events in human language.
Live integration is intentionally not enabled in this MVP.

## Disclaimer
This project is for defensive research and educational purposes only.
